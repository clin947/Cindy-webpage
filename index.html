                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am currently a forth-year undergraduated student majoring Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Pronouns: She/Her.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>Currently, I am working as a Robotics Software Engineer Intern at AI CHA, where I'm developing a voice-activated interaction system for a Unitree robot.  I also have experience in game development and web applications, having worked on projects such as <a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/d983cae9-9b8c-45c3-ba9a-351c7adde4b2/live-or-die-with-your-best-friend" target="_blank">Live or Die With Your Best Friend</a> and <a href="https://happycows.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Happy Cows (newest version)</a>.</p>
