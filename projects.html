        <div class="project">
            <h3 style="display: inline;">Hangman Game</h3>
            <p class="sub-note" style="display: inline;">March 2025</p>
            <p>A terminal-based Hangman game written in C using socket programming. I built both the multithreaded game server and the client from scratch. The server can handle up to 3 simultaneous players, selects a random word from a word bank, tracks game state, and provides real-time feedback. The client allows players to input guesses and displays server responses.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 style="display: inline;">Floating Archery</h3>
            <p class="sub-note" style="display: inline;">May 2024 - June 2024</p>
            <p>A virtual reality archery game developed with Unity, designed to help users practice archery by aiming at floating targets. We utilized a free 3D bow and arrow model from an online asset store and implemented custom scripts that enabled players to realistically shoot arrows in the VR environment. Besides the main shooting system, I also built a real-time tracking system to display the number of arrows shot and the number of successful hits on targets, enhancing both user feedback and game immersion.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 style="display: inline;">Live or Die With Your Best Friend</h3>
            <p class="sub-note" style="display: inline;">January 2024 - March 2024</p>
            <p>A cooperative multiplayer survival game built in Unity where players must work together to withstand waves of enemies. I collaborated with teammates on game design and implemented core gameplay mechanics including enemy movement and attack behaviors. I also developed the UI/UX for key features such as the tutorial screen, and created a user manual to improve onboarding and player understanding. As part of the final showcase, our team produced a demo video and presentation slides, helping our project win 1st place in the audience choice awards out of 14 teams.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 style="display: inline;">Happy Cows</h3>
            <p class="sub-note" style="display: inline;">July 2023 - September 2023</p>
            <p>A web-based simulation game developed using Java and JavaScript. I enhanced the game's usability by debugging existing issues and introducing new features. These included navigational improvements like back buttons, UI refinements such as removing redundant purchase popups, and the development of a new "profit page" that reports daily cow price updates to the player.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 style="display: inline;">Mafia Mayhem The Game</h3>
            <p class="sub-note" style="display: inline;">May 2023 - June 2023</p>
            <p>A murder mystery visual novel game developed with Ren'Py. I integrated my teammates' narrative scripts into the Ren'Py scripting system and implemented interactive branching choices that led to different scenes and story outcomes.  This structure allowed players to influence the storyline through their decisions, creating a more dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.</p>
